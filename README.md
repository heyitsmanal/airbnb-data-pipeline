# Airbnb Data Pipeline (Python • Airflow • Docker • PostgreSQL)

A compact, production-style ETL that ingests Airbnb listings (CSV or API), cleans and validates them with pandas, and loads them into a PostgreSQL data warehouse. Orchestrated daily with Apache Airflow.

## Why this project?
I built this to demonstrate practical **Data Engineering** skills relevant to real teams:
- Containerized orchestration with **Airflow**
- **ETL** with Python (pandas) and **SQLAlchemy**
- **PostgreSQL** data modeling and loading
- Clear, reproducible **Docker Compose** setup
